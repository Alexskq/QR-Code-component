## My process

I'm complety new in web development after some lessons in HTML/CSS, I start this project by creating HTML then all the style with CSS.

I thought background looks like not enough "dark" than the preview. I don't know why may be because of my web browser.

I let everyone give me some feedback and advices to perform this code.

Thanks.
